# AoC2022
My python code for Advent of Code 2022


So far:
- my Day 4 code is definitely very overcomplicated, I'll try to rework it when I have some time
- Day 5 had a lot of smaller mistakes in it, which took quite a bit to fix
- Day 6 was a lot easier than Day 5, also probably my cleanest AoC Code so far
- Day 7 ran into quite a lot of self-imposed issues
